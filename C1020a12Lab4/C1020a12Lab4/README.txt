Relevance Question 1:
Winnie the Pooh seems to be slightly more extraverted than the mean, 
extremely more agreeable than the mean, 
a bit less concientious than the mean, 
he is extremely neurotic compared to the mean, 
and is less open to new experiences than the mean.

Relevance Question 2:
Aside from Winnie the Pooh being 100 years old and myself being 29 causing a huge age gap,
his high amount of neuroticism would make working with him quite difficult as I would anticipate
he either is too scared to say something is done or ready for me which would cause babysitting
or worse that he would be too scared that others are out to get him almost to a paranoid state.
Also having someone who would most likely just agree with me would be bad as I actually struggle
with a few employees of mine who don't stand up and just say "yes" when they have a different
opinion. I would prefer someone different to work with than Winnie the Pooh, I would much rather
have them as a friend to spend a nice Saturday with.
